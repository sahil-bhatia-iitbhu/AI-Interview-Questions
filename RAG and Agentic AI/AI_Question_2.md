### 🚀 INTERVIEW - From Chatbots to Engineers: The Agentic AI Revolution

Interviewer: What's the biggest shift happening in AI roles right now?
Candidate: The industry is pivoting from "build a model" to "build a system." Companies aren't looking for experiments anymore—they aim for automation, predictable outcomes, and end-to-end workflows.

Interviewer: How does Agentic AI differ from traditional AI?
Candidate: Traditional AI is static model predictions—feed in data, get answers. Agentic AI? It thinks like a junior engineer: multi-step reasoning, tool calling, API integration, self-correction. It plans, executes, and learns from mistakes. It gets work done, not just answers questions.

Interviewer: What powers these agents?
Candidate: Five core components: (1) Reasoning loops (thought + action), (2) Tool calling & APIs, (3) Memory (short & long-term), (4) RAG for grounded answers, (5) Planning & multi-agent orchestration. Together, they reduce operational workload by 40-70%.
Interviewer: What skills are essential for an Agentic AI Expert?
Candidate: Prompt design for agents, Python fundamentals, LangGraph/LangChain, RAG implementation, API integration, system design thinking, and FastAPI + Docker for deployment.
