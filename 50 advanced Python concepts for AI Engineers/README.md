# 50 Advanced Python Concepts for Senior Interviews

This repository contains code samples and explanations for 50 advanced Python concepts that are commonly tested in senior Python developer interviews. These concepts focus on memory management, performance optimization, and writing clean, maintainable code—key skills that separate senior engineers from mid-level developers.

## Watch the Video

I walk through these concepts in my YouTube video:

[![50 Advanced Python Concepts to get a Senior Develop Job in 2025](https://img.youtube.com/vi/QgC5lj54TNg/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgC5lj54TNg)

## Why This List?

I've done over 25 interviews for senior Python developer positions, some with compensation up to $200k. During these interviews, I noticed that most Python prep materials cover only the basics—leaving candidates unprepared for the deeper technical questions that truly matter at the senior level.

This repository is a result of my experience. Learning these concepts (especially asyncio and concurrency/paralellism) has personally helped me land job offers paying up to $10k/month.

## What You'll Find Here

- Code examples illustrating each concept
- Explanations of why these concepts matter in real-world applications
- A study guide to help you prepare for senior Python interviews

## Handbook (Readable Notes)

If you prefer a readable, notes-style walkthrough (instead of jumping straight into the `.py` files), check out the `handbook/` folder. It groups the 50 concepts into four markdown documents you can use as a study reference alongside the code samples:

```
handbook/
├── 50_main_concepts_1_10.md
├── 50_main_concepts_11_25.md
├── 50_main_concepts_26_40.md
└── 50_main_concepts_41_50.md
```

These files mirror the concepts from the video and repo, but in a more “handbook” format for faster reading and review.

Happy coding and best of luck with your interviews! 🚀
